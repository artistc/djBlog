A blog engine written in Django as an exercise.
It is quite functional, but editing posts is quite a pain.
Although it was a good exercise, I do not feel like reinventing the wheel and trying to "compete" with real, mature blog engines.
However I am quite happy with the design, so I will probably keep it for the real blog, most likely powered by wordpress.
